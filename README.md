# parity-net-tls-hub

`parity-net-tls-hub` is a TypeScript project for Networking. It turns design a TypeScript verification harness for tls systems, covering state machine modeling, transition tables, and failure-oriented tests into a small local model with readable fixtures and a direct verification command.

## Reading Parity Net TLS Hub

Start with the README, then open `metadata/project.json` to check the constants behind the examples. After that, `fixtures/cases.csv` shows the compact path and `examples/extended_cases.csv` gives a wider look at the same rule.

## What It Does

- Includes extended examples for retry behavior, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents policy decisions tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Purpose

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Files Worth Reading

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `package.json`: Node package scripts

## Design Sketch

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps packet shape, socket state, and retry behavior in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 183, with risk penalty 4, latency penalty 4, and weight bonus 2. The TypeScript project keeps types close to the model and compiles before running its checks.

## Usage

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Fixture Notes

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Verification

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Limits

The fixture set is deliberately small. That keeps the review surface clear, but it also means the model should not be treated as a complete domain simulator.

## Next Directions

- Add a comparison mode that shows how decisions change when one signal is adjusted.
- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add one more networking fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Setup

Clone the repository, enter the directory, and run the verifier. No database server, cloud account, or token is required.
